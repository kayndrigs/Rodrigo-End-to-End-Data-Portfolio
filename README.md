According to JoshDev, this is a series that empowers any data enthusiast to leverage their knowledge and skills in doing data-engineering tasks such as creating data pipelines using Python, SQL, and configuring FTP servers using Linux distro. Beyond that, it also encompasses the creation of dashboards, data analysis, and machine learning model training, which overall covers all data-related specialization. 

# Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Create virtual environment with: `python -m venv env`
   - note: `.gitignore` added to avoid git push of environment into the repository. 
3. Activate environment (assuming that the directory is loaded in the terminal)
   - `env\Scripts\activate.bat` (windows command prompt)
   - `env\Scripts\activate.ps1` (powershell)
   - `source env/Scripts/activate` (git bash)
4. Install the packages with: `pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

# Episode 2: Version control and virtual environment essentials
- Review of git and github usage for uploading projects to repositories
- Commonly used Git commands: (git must be installed)
  - git init . # dot for current directory
  - git add . # dot for all changes
  - git commit -m "Added new message"
  - git rm <filename.file> # remove files
  - git push
  - git pull
  - git fork # forks a repository
- note: always create a unique sub-branch when working with organizational repository
- assigns github account and push changes to GitHub Repository

# Episode 3: Extracting data from web to FTP using Python
- Performed setup of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and using Ubuntu as the distro.
- Installed vsftpd for FTP (port 21) server for unix systems with configured settings.
- Created another python environment suitable for creating FTP servers in linux.
- Using the environment, performed the connection to FTP server and established an SSH-encrypted connection.
- Established a data pipeline for data extraction and upload.
- Created an automated python CSV generator functions used on dataset links from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
- Uploaded the generated the csv file to the FTP server, and deleted from the local filesystem.
- Created a script for manual or scheduled tasks based on their keyword as parameter.
  - **error handling**:
    - case 1:  User is not in Sudoers File. This incident will be reported - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmClYPXko9k

- Discussion of ETL Concepts
  - ETL can be interchangeable to ELT or EL
- Transferred Vsftpd Flat Files to Local Directory
- Created ODBC Connection for Postgresql in ODBC Data Source Administrator
- Loaded local Flat Files to Postgresql DB through SSIS
